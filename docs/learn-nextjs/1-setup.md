# Setup NextJS Project

## Create Project

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```

## Project Layout

- /app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
- /app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
- /app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
- /public: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
- /scripts: Contains a seeding script that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.
- Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.

## Command To Use

pnpm run dev
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
