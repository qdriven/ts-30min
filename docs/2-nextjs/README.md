# Nextjs Quickstart

> Building Blocks of a Web Application
There are a few things you need to consider when building modern applications. Such as:

User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
Integrations - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
Developer Experience - your teamâ€™s experience building and maintaining your application.
