Vaccinations are crucial for protecting your puppy from serious and potentially life-threatening diseases. Puppies are more susceptible to infections, and their immune systems are still developing, making vaccinations a top priority. Here are the essential vaccinations your puppy needs:

### 1. Distemper

Distemper is a highly contagious and potentially fatal viral disease that affects a puppy's respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Vaccination against distemper is essential to prevent this disease.

### 2. Parvovirus

Parvovirus is another highly contagious viral disease that causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms, leading to dehydration and even death, especially in young puppies. Vaccination against parvovirus is critical for your puppy's health.

### 3. Adenovirus Type 2 (Hepatitis)

Hepatitis is a viral disease that affects a puppy's liver and respiratory system. Vaccination against adenovirus type 2 helps protect your puppy from this serious illness.

### 4. Canine Parainfluenza

Canine parainfluenza is one of the viruses responsible for kennel cough, a highly contagious respiratory infection. Including this vaccination in your puppy's immunization schedule helps safeguard their respiratory health.

### 5. Rabies

Rabies is a deadly viral disease that can affect both dogs and humans. In many places, rabies vaccination is required by law. It is crucial to ensure your puppy receives the rabies vaccine at the appropriate age.

### 6. Bordetella (Kennel Cough)

Bordetella bronchiseptica is one of the bacteria that cause kennel cough. If your puppy will be in contact with other dogs, such as in boarding facilities or dog parks, vaccinating against Bordetella is recommended.

### 7. Leptospirosis

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects the liver and kidneys. It can also be transmitted to humans. Vaccination against leptospirosis is important, especially if your puppy will be exposed to wildlife, bodies of water, or high-risk environments.

### 8. Canine Influenza

Canine influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that can lead to severe coughing and difficulty breathing. If your puppy will interact with other dogs, consider vaccinating against canine influenza.

Before administering any vaccinations, consult with your veterinarian to create a personalized vaccination schedule based on your puppy's breed, age, lifestyle, and local disease prevalence. Regular booster shots are necessary to maintain your puppy's immunity. By staying up-to-date with vaccinations, you're ensuring a healthier and happier life for your beloved furry friend.
